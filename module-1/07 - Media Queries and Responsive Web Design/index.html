                    <h2>What makes a website responsive?</h2>
                    <p>Responsive web design requires three things:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>It must have a <strong>fluid layout</strong>.</li>
                        <li>It needs <strong>flexible images</strong>.</li>
                        <li>It should use <strong>media queries</strong>.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>We've already introduced fluid layouts and flexible images, so let's dive right into media queries.</p>
                </section>
            </div>
            
            
            <section class="narrow-container">
                <h2>What are media queries?</h2>
                <p>Media queries allow us to apply different styles or use different layouts based upon whether or not a <strong>condition</strong> is met. This condition might be whether or not the screen is a certain size, if the user is printing the page, or if the user is holding their device in portrait or landscape orientation.</p>
                <p>The condition in a media query always resolves as <strong>true</strong> (i.e. yes, this thing is happening) or <strong>false</strong> (i.e. no, this thing is not happening).</p>
                <p>Most of the time, we're going to use media queries to check if the <strong>viewport</strong> is a <strong>certain size</strong>. If it is, we can change the layout and add additional rules; if not, all of the rules inside the media query will be ignored.</p>

                <h2>Taking a mobile-first design approach.</h2>
                <p>When building responsive websites, we need to take a <strong>mobile-first design approach</strong>. This means we must begin with creating an optimized experience for mobile devices before scaling up to larger screens such as tablets and desktop monitors.</p>
                <p>There are a few reasons why taking a mobile-first is extremely important.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It's <strong>much easier</strong> to add a few additional rules at the bottom of your stylesheet in order to create wider layouts rather than try to undo what you've already done to create narrower layouts.</li>
                    <li>Mobile-first design often leads to <strong>better performance</strong> because it prioritizes efficiency and speed on mobile devices, which typically have more limited resources than desktops.</li>
                    <li>As the vast <strong>majority of users have a mobile device</strong>, a mobile-first approach ensures that your website remains relevant and accessible to the majority of users.</li>
                    <li>Search engines like Google prioritize mobile-friendly websites in their rankings, so a mobile-first design can improve your site's visibility and <strong>search engine rankings</strong>.</li>
                </ol>
